# KARTAVYA (Our little Journey)
I am  Sagar Gaud ,this initiative taken by me and my peer group. I am a student at Bundelkhand Institute of engineering and technology 3rd yr Btech. I saw people living on road don't have clothes for sleeping don't have food to eat so i started helping them in 2021 I collected 11000 rupees from my colleagues and purchase blankets and distributed them in those people.
 Now again I want to raise funds for those people and successfully collected good amount for them by my own college as well as outside by support of KETTO.(Ketto is an Online Crowdfunding Platform and Website in India for fundraising of Social, Charity, Movies, Music, Personal and Creative causes.)
